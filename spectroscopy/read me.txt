#---- "irradiance" ----
Spectrographic measurements of light sources in the wind tunnel setup. Measurements were 
taken with a calibrated Ocean Optics USB-2000 spectrophotometer. Values given in Âµwatts/cm2.

#---- "reflectance and transmission" ----
Spectrographic measurements of the reflectance and transmission of surfaces in the 
wind tunnel setup. Measurements were taken with a Ocean Optics USB-2000 spectrophotometer.
Reflection measurements were calibrated with a 99% Spectralon reflectance standard.

#---- "figure 1B.(R)" ----
R code to generate pdf of panel B of "figures/figure 1"". Pulls LED spectra from
"/spectroscopy/irradiance/LED synth channels". Spectra then scaled based on the pwm values
taken from "photography/color stimuli/2023-05-10/Spectral Sweep Side Comparision v5.xlsx"
and accounts for transmission through layers of black tulle taken from 
"spectroscopy/reflectance and transmission/black tulle tansmission.csv". The inset images
of the visual stimuli are taken from the "jpeg" images in 
"photography/color stimuli/2023-05-10"

#---- "figure S1.(R)" ----
R code to generate pdf of "figures/figure S1". Irradiance, reflectance, and transmission data 
pulled from the relevant subfolders.
