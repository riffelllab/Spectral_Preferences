#---- "LED synth channels" ----
Spectrographic measurements related to the visual stimuli generated by the
paired (side a and b) LED synths. Measurements were taken with the cosine
corrector attached to the fiber optic cable leading to spectrometer placed flush
with floor of the windtunnel and in the center of the visual stimulus. The
measurement was taken through the white cotton broadcloth of the fabric liner
but the tulle bullseyes were removed to increase the amount of light reaching
the spectrometer.

	#---- "full int" ----
	Measurements of the LED channels at full intensity (pwm = 4096)
	
	#---- "test int (1.0)" ----
	Measurements of the LED channels at a preliminary estimate of the test intensity (1.0).
	This was refined further by photographic measurements. The pwm values used are recorded
	in "preliminary pwm.csv".
	See "photography/color stimuli/2023-05-10/"
	
	#---- "a 570 baseline.txt" ----
	This was the initial measurement of ~3/4 of full brightness of the dimmest LED channel
	(570 nm) from the dimmest side (side a). All other channels were then dialed down
	to match this brightness
	
	#---- "fitted stimulus intensity.pdf" ----
	PDF graph generated by "LED synth channels.R" showing the preliminary estimate of the
	intensities of the LED channels on sides a and b. This was further refined by
	photographic measurements (see above).
	
	#---- "led integrals fit.csv" ----
	#csv output from "LED synth channels.R" showing an preliminary estimate of the photon
	catch of each channel on each side at the test (1.0) intensity.
	
	#---- "led integrals full.csv" ----
	csv output from "LED synth channels.R" showing the calculated  photon catch of
	each channel on each side at full intensity (pwm = 4096). Estimates of each
	LED channels peak wavelength are saved in the file and pulled from here by
	other scripts.
	
	#---- "LED synth channels.R" ----
	R script for importing, processing, and graphing LED spectra as well as estimating 
	photon catches.
	
	#---- "preliminary pwm.csv" ----
	The pwm values used for the "test int (1.0)" measurements.
	
	
#---- "composite gray spectra.(R|csv)" ----
This R file outputs the csv file containing a composite "gray" visual stimulus at the
baseline "1.00" intensity along with the component spectra of the LED channels creating
the composite spectra. Spectra from "/spectroscopy/irradiance/LED synth channels" are 
used and scaled with pwm values taken from 
"photography/gray stimuli/2023-04-23/grey-1.00 light spot photo measurment v4.xlsx".
	
#---- "IR LED strips.csv" ----
Irradiance of the IR backlights (B07ZZ2LJKY, 360DigitalSignage) located on the sides and 
below the wind tunnel to provide illumination for the 3D tracking cameras.

#---- "projector.csv" ----
Irradiance of the DLP projectors (LG PH450U) providing the illumination to the wind tunnel
in the form of a horizon formed by a light gray (white) and dark gray (gray) horizon 
(see Fig. 1c). The measurements were taken outside the wind tunnel directly in front of
projectors.
