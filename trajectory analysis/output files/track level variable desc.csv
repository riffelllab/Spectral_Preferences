Variable Name,Description
genotype,Genotype of mosquitos used in the run. Only wildtype (wt) mosquitos were used in these experiments 
sex,Sex of mosquitos used in the run. Only females (f) were used in these experiments 
rep,"The time code based individual identifier for each rep/run. Used this naming formula ""YYYYMMDD_hhmmss"". With ""YYYY"" giving the four digit year, ""MM"" the two digit month, ""DD"" the two digit day, ""hh"" the two digit hour on a 24 hour clock, ""mm"" the two digits minute, and ""ss"" the two digit second."
event,"The name of the event/stimulus presented during that period (IE PreStim, spectral downsweep, 545 nm)"
stim_series,"Name for either a series of stimuli displayed (IE intensity ramp, spectral downsweep, 470 nm intensity ramp) or a single control stimuli (IE PreCO2Time, PreStim, resp check, PostCO2Time)"
trt_side,"Was the treatment side displayed on side ""a"" (right side facing downwind) or side ""b"" (left side facing downwind)"
odor,"The odor present during this stimulus (IE air, CO2, CO2 + tansy)"
trt_color,"The color of the treatment side visual stimulus (IE 385-740, gray, or 'all' leds off aka black)"
trt_intensity,The intensity of the treatment stimulus. Spectral sweep intensity for all stimuli is 1.00
ctr_color,"The color of the treatment side visual stimulus ussually ""gray"""
ctr_intensity,"The intensity of the control stimulus. Typical internsity for the ""gray"" control was 0.50."
duration,The track duration in seconds
trt_time,"The time spent within the fictive cylinder centered on the test stimulus (diameter: 14 cm, height: 4 cm). "
ctr_time,"The time spent within the fictive cylinder centered on the test stimulus (diameter: 14 cm, height: 4 cm). "
stim_time,"The time spent within the fictive cylinders centered on the test  and control stimuli (diameter: 14 cm, height: 4 cm). "
pref_index,"Preference index (PI) characterizing the preference for the test stimulus.
PI = (trt_time - ctr_time) / (trt_time + ctr_time) "
