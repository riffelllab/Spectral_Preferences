Variable Name,Description
genotype,Genotype of mosquitos used in the run. Only wildtype (wt) mosquitos were used in these experiments 
sex,Sex of mosquitos used in the run. Only females (f) were used in these experiments 
rep,"The time code based individual identifier for each rep/run. Used this naming formula ""YYYYMMDD_hhmmss"". With ""YYYY"" giving the four digit year, ""MM"" the two digit month, ""DD"" the two digit day, ""hh"" the two digit hour on a 24 hour clock, ""mm"" the two digits minute, and ""ss"" the two digit second."
event,"The name of the event/stimulus presented during that period (IE PreStim, spectral downsweep, 545 nm)"
stim_series,"Name for either a series of stimuli displayed (IE intensity ramp, spectral downsweep, 470 nm intensity ramp) or a single control stimuli (IE PreCO2Time, PreStim, resp check, PostCO2Time)"
odor,"The odor present during this stimulus (IE air, CO2, CO2 + tansy)"
trt_color,"The color of the treatment side visual stimulus (IE 385-740, gray, or 'all' leds off aka black)"
trt_intensity,The intensity of the treatment stimulus. Spectral sweep intensity for all stimuli is 1.00
ctr_color,"The color of the treatment side visual stimulus ussually ""gray"""
ctr_intensity,"The intensity of the control stimulus. Typical internsity for the ""gray"" control was 0.50."
event_length,The length of the event in minutes
n_tracks,The number of trajectories during the event period
activity_index,"The sum of all track durations during an event normalized by the first event (""PreCO2Time"")"
mean_duration,The mean duration of the trajectories in seconds during each event
min_duration,The min duration of the trajectories in seconds during each event
max_duration,The max duration of the trajectories in seconds during each event
mean_track_dist,The mean distance in meters traveled during a trajectory during each event
mean_track_speed,The mean speed of trajectories in meters/second during each event
n_tracks_resp,The number of trajectories responding to either the test or control stimuli during the event period
p_tracks_resp,The proportion of trajectories responding to either the test or control stimuli during the event period
mean_pref_index,"The estimated preference index (from a single run/rep betabinomial generalized linear model) for all trajectories during the event period, weighted by track duration. Preference index (PI) is calculated from the proportion (p) of time spent near the test stimuli as compared with the amount of time spent near either the test or control stimuli using the formula: PI = 2p-1."
conf.low,"The lower extent of a 95% confidence interval around the ""mean_pref_index"""
conf.high,"The upper extent of a 95% confidence interval around the ""mean_pref_index"""
p_value,P-value testing if an individual event coeffiicient from a single run/rep betabinomial generalized linear model differs from the expected 50:50.
